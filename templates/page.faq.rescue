     <a id="materials"><h3>Materials</h3></a>
    <p>
      <strong>OX:</strong> Our oxidized finish is a special treatment of our sterling silver that gives it a blackened surface. This surface finish wears off over time with the friction against the skin, revealing the silver underneath to create a silvery-black patina.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Brass:</strong> We use brass that comes from refinery that is certified as green.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Kohl:</strong> Our Kohl finish is a nickel-free ruthenium black plating. It is more permanent than oxidation and has a matte gunmetal look. This is used in our rings and pieces that are intended to stay black over time.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Vermeil:</strong> We use a heavy 14kt gold plating that is 3 times as thick as common gold plating.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Gold:</strong> 14kt/18kt Yellow, Rose, Green or White gold. All of our gold is made using 100% recycled.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Please Note:</strong> Vanessa Lianne Jewelry is all hand made using recycled metals and conflict free stones.

    <a id="care"><h3>How to Care for your VL Jewelry</h3></a>
    <p>
      Vanessa Lianne jewelry is all handmade and will change over time. Oxidized silver gradually fades with wear but can be re-oxidized. If you would like your item re-oxidized you may do this free of charge. Email <a href="mailto:info@vanessalianne.com" target="_top">info@vanessalianne.com</a> for more details.<br/><br/>
      While many people appreciate the unique patina of matte finished jewelry, it eventually shines with wear but can be re-matted using the light touch of a green 3M pad.
      Over time, silver and brass will oxidize. To clean your VL jewelry without removing the satin finish, use a paste of baking soda and water and rub it over the item in a circular motion with an old toothbrush. You can use brass cleaner on your brass jewelry; follow the instructions on te bottle. To avoid oxidation keep jewelry in a sealed container.
